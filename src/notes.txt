In React,
1) React is not having any tools, functions or any thing like objects for making HTTP CALLS.
2) React can only do this things
 a) showing the content and handling events, props, state
3) without knowing the react, we can do HTTP calls


to do the http calls we have to use axios in react

1) to make any requests we have to use axios or fetch

In javascript axios

syntax: Axios

axios.get(url, {
    headers: {

    },

    params: {

    }
});

here 
1) get: Request method also we have put, post, del, patch
2) URL: where we want to make the request to the server
3) headers: headers that we want to add into the request
4) params: key-value pairs that will be turned into a query string and added to the URL

axios.get('https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos', {
    headers: {
        Authorization: Client-ID JC9jax40jXvMoppukxjDJYlzp2iQ1KQx3ppObgoSfgA
    },

    params: {
        query: "mobiles"
    }
});
